# Sudoku Solver using Dancing Link Algorithm.
>## Outline
Sudoku (Sudoku) is given when there is a single digit to advance several elements in the matrix of 9X9 size, appears every row and every column from a one-digit number 1 to 9 only one time each, and all of the nine 3X3 size Small even the nine elements in the matrix, the number of single-digit from 1 to 9 only one time each will determine the elements of the matrix in the space to appear.
To solve this problem sudoku, the first resolution using the method of Backtracking. But how Backtracking takes a long time to search all due respect to cases that are likely to Finding the answer.
Therefore, by applying the Dancing Link Algorithm allows to return to perform well even when the larger dimension of the matrix to the destination than when implemented as a method of Backtracking.
